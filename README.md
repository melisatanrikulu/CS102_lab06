# CS102_lab06

To solve the core problem you are not allowed to use loops, you can only use for secondary purposes such as printing the characters of an array etc.

---------------

Question 1

Count the length of the string that is given using recursion.


Example:

Input: "CS102 is the best"

Output: 17

Question 2

Find the number of non-vowels in a given array of characters/string using recursion. We do not care about the case(upper or lower) in this problem.

Example:

Input: "CS102 is a good course"
Output: 8

Question 3

Generate all binary strings of length n (that is your input) without 1's that come together using recursion.
Examples:

Input: n = 3

Output: 101

100

010

001

000

Input: n = 4

Output:1010

1001

1000

0101

0100

0010

0001

0000

Question 4

Write a recursive method to find the number of files on your computer's disk for a given directory. Note that a directory may also contain subdirectories. Hint: Check the File class from the below link. In particular look at the listFiles(), isFile() and isDirectory() methods, plus the File(String directory) constructor.
